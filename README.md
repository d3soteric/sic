# Sharing is Caring
SiC is a script to help find overshared files in a simple,
yet powerful location in OneDrive: "Shared with Everyone"

The script authenticates as a domain user
then checks against a list to see if any of the
included users have files in their shared with everyone folder
that user can see

A list of filenames is returned for further analysis
